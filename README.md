# Project AI Automation

## Overview

Project AI Automation is an Odoo module designed to streamline and automate various aspects of project management using artificial intelligence. It enhances project efficiency by automating project setup, task assignment, scheduling, tracking, evaluation, and feedback learning.

## Features

- **Automated Project Setup:** Simplifies the creation and configuration of new projects.
- **AI-Based Task Assignment:** Automatically assigns tasks to the most suitable team members based on skills, workload, and historical data.
- **Smart Scheduling:** Utilizes AI algorithms to generate optimal project schedules and timelines.
- **Project and Task Tracking:** Provides real-time tracking of project progress and task completion.
- **Evaluation and Feedback:** Implements AI-driven evaluation and feedback mechanisms to facilitate continuous learning and team improvement.
- **Seamless Integration:** Extends the standard Odoo Project module for easy adoption.
- **Integration with AI Models:** Connects with external or custom AI models (such as machine learning APIs or LLMs) to enhance project automation processes, including advanced predictions, intelligent recommendations, and adaptive scheduling.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the Odoo Project module installed.
2. Copy this module into your Odoo add-ons directory.
3. Update the app list and install "Project AI Automation" from the Odoo interface.

## Dependencies

- `project` (Odoo standard Project module)
- Optional: External AI service (RESTful API or local deployment) for enhanced automation features.

## Usage

Once installed, you will find new automation options within the Project app. Configure AI automation settings from the project form view, and let the system assist with task management and team performance.

### AI Model Integration

This module is designed to be flexible with AI integrations. You can connect it to:
- Pre-built machine learning APIs (for task prediction, resource optimization, etc.)
- Custom LLMs or AI models (via RESTful endpoints)
- On-premise or cloud-based AI services

Configuration options for AI endpoints and authentication can be managed from the moduleâ€™s settings page.

## Configuration

No special configuration is required beyond the standard Odoo Project setup. AI integration parameters (such as API keys or endpoints) can be set in the module's settings.
